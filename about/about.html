        <br>
        <h3 class="masthead-subheading mb-0">Do you like having arguments with your friends over what is "the greatest snack food"? (Correct answer: Chewy Chips Ahoy!) Do you want to spend an afternoon determing what is "the best John Legend song" ? (Correct Answer: "Green Light") Well, Brakit is here for you! We wanted to make a definitive list of all the top snack foods, songs by certain artists, sitcoms, etc., and then have our friends pick which ones were the best in head-to-head matchups. Brakit is great for video calls with multiple friends, when you want to have "tame" disputes over why their picks suck and yours are amazing. Brakit helps you uncover who's actually your friend and who has terrible taste.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="masthead-subheading mb-0"> Most online brackets you find on the interwebs are not very user friendly. They either require you to print it out on paper and write your answers in with a pen (what is this 1991?!), or they require you to edit a PDF version or Excel verion of the bracket, which makes it tedious to do. Brakit picks can be made from anywhere that has an internect connection. Brakit is better on a desktop (best on Google Chrome), but can be acsessed from a smartphone or tablet as well (though the formatting gets a little janky). If you are acsessing from a non-desktop, it's best to do the "Request Desktop Version" option from your mobile web browser. Ultimately, Brakit is a fun side hobby of various bracket games on different topics, that we wanted to share with the world. Enjoy the brackets we've already made, and if you'd like to see any others, shoot us a message (email below). Happy Brakit-ing!</h3>

                  <p>Andrew is one-half of the brains behind Brakit. After doing many manual Excel brackets for the greatest episodes of the Office, Parks and Rec, and a myriad of other excellent Michael Schur shows, he was fed up that there wasn't an easy-to-use website through which he could play out all of these matchups. An expert at Googling, he bullshitted his way into creating and hosting this site. He really hopes you enjoy this site because, and he cannot stress this enough, he has spent waaaaay too much time tinkering with it. </p>

                  <p>Nicole is one-half of the brains behind Brakit. After doing many manual Excel brackets for the greatest episodes of the Office, Parks and Rec, and a myriad of other excellent Michael Schur shows, she was fed up that Andrew had too much free time on his hands and "encouraged" him to create this website. Having no actual coding experience, Nicole served as the strategic vision behind the website (in other words, she told Andrew what to code). She was a consultant on all Brakits created thus far.  </p>

                  <p>The only person with ACTUAL experience to back up her title, graphic designer Maeve created the kick-ass logo you see on the top of all the pages <i>and</i> picked out the color scheme for the whole site (mainly Pacific Blue and Green RYB, with a little Eggshell to offset). She served as the point person for the One Hit Wonder Brakit, as well as a consultant on a few others. A modern-day Renaissance woman if there was one.</p>

He took the lead on the Cereal Brakit and, surprisingly, the Taylor Swift Brakit. He also helped in the development of our hover picture feature. He's got big opinions (especially against Tostitos Crispy Rounds and the near omission of "We Are Never Getting Back Together"), but an even bigger heart. </p>
