# Brakit

Do you like having arguments with your friends over "the greatest snack food is..."? (Correct answer: Chewy Chips Ahoy!) Do you want to spend an afternoon determing "the best John Legend song..." ? (Correct Answer: "Green Light") Well, Brakit is here for you! We wanted to make a definitive list of all the top snack foods, songs by certain artists, sitcoms, etc., and then have our friends pick which ones were the best in head-to-head matchups. Brakit is great for video calls with multiple friends, when you want to have tame disputes over why their tastes suck and yours are amazing. Brakit helps you uncover who's actually your friend and who has terrible taste. Ultimately, Brakit is a fun side hobby that we wanted to share with the world.
