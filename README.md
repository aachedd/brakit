# Brakit

Do you like having arguments with your friends over "the greatest snack food is..."? (Correct answer: Chewy Chips Ahoy!) Do you want to spend an afternoon determing "the best John Legend song..." ? (Correct Answer: "Green Light") Well, Brakit is here for you! We wanted to make a definitive list of all the top snack foods, songs by certain artists, sitcoms, etc., and then have our friends pick which ones were the best in head-to-head matchups. Brakit is great for video calls with multiple friends, when you want to have tame disputes over why their tastes suck and yours are amazing. Brakit helps you uncover who's actually your friend and who has terrible taste. Ultimately, Brakit is a fun side hobby that we wanted to share with the world.

Most online brackets you find on the interwebs are not very user friendly. They either require you to print it out on paper and write your answers in with a pen (what is this 1991?!), or they require you to edit a PDF version or Excel verion of the bracket, which makes it tedious to do. Brakit picks can be made from anywhere that has an internect connection. Brakit is better on a desktop (best on Google Chrome), but can be acsessed from a smartphone or tablet as well (though the formatting gets a little janky). If you are acsessing from a non-desktop, it's best to do the "Request Desktop Version" option from your mobile web browser. Ultimately, Brakit is a fun side hobby of various bracket games on different topics, that we wanted to share with the world. Enjoy the brackets we've already made, and if you'd like to see any others, shoot us a message (email below). Happy Brakit-ing!
